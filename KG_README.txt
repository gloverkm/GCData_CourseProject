README for Course Project in Getting and Cleaning Data

This script should work for you from start to finish, but it will create a folder called 
KGproject. Might not want that forever if you load this.

The script has descriptions that could be cleaner as some things were notes to future 
users. Also, I left some unnecessary commands that I left intact so that you could 
check my work as you go, or, even better, make suggestions on how I could better code 
as I am a newbie. 

While I do create a txt file at the end, the final lines of code will allow you to read
the table back into R to check things out.

Thank you for your feedback, and cheers, k
